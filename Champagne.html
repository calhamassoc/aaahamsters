	<td colspan=12 rowspan=1 width=516><span style="font-size:14">Champagne (aabbddpp) is the four-gene color.&nbsp; It is the combination of all four of the currently known color genes in the Campbells:&nbsp; Opal, Argente, Black-eyed Argente, and Black.&nbsp; Since all of these colors are recessive, the hamsters must have two copies of each of these genes to appear Champagne.&nbsp; It is not difficult to breed a Champagne if you have all four combinable color genes -- but you must have all four of the genes.&nbsp; It is always easiest to only add one gene at a time.&nbsp; Thus, it is best to start with any two three-gene colors which will have one overlapping gene.&nbsp; Then you can also predict what you get and recognize the colors when you get them (which is not trivial with these newer colors).&nbsp; It is also easier to know what genes your babies carry when you start with two three-gene colors.<br><br>To breed a Champagne, you would start with two different three-gene colors like Red-eyed Lilac (RE Lilac) and Blue Beige (Dark Beige or Black-eyed Lilac work equally as well if you make the substitutions).&nbsp; Between these two hamsters, you cover all four of the combinable Campbells color genes.&nbsp; Since RE Lilac is the combined color for Black, Opal, and Argente, you are only missing the Black-eyed Argente gene to get to Champagne.&nbsp; Since Blue Beige is the combined color for Opal, Argente, and Black-eyed Argente, you are only missing the Black gene to get to Champagne.<br><br>So you would breed the RE Lilac to the Blue Beige.&nbsp; Since Opal and Argente are the overlapping colors, you should get all Blue Fawn babies carrying Black and Black-eyed Argente.&nbsp; You would then breed two of these Blue Fawn babies together.&nbsp; From this pairing, you should get approximately 9/16 Blue Fawns, 3/16 RE Lilac, 3/16 Blue Beige, and 1/16 Champagne.<br><br>It is a bit trickeir but still doable if you start with a three-gene color and a two-gene color.&nbsp; Let's take the example of breeding an RE Lilac to a Beige.&nbsp; RE Lilac is the three gene color for Opal, Black, and Argente.&nbsp; Beige is the two-gene color for Argente and Black-eyed argente.&nbsp; All four of the combinable color genes are represented. So if you breed the RE Lilac to the Beige, you should get all Argentes carrying Opal, Black, and Black-eyed Argente.&nbsp; You then breed two of these Argentes together.&nbsp; From this pairing of argentes, you should get approximately 27/64 Argentes, 9/64 Beige, 9/64 Dove, 9/64 Blue Fawn, 3/64 RE Lilac, 3/64 Dark Beige, 3/64 Blue Beige, and 1/64 Champagne.<br><br>As you can see, it can take a lot of litters to get to Champagne this way with a lot of other colors popping up along the way.&nbsp; The reality is that with a single pair, you may never get a blue beige since these are all statistics.&nbsp; Again, it is preferable to start with two different three-gene colors instead.&nbsp; Starting with two different two-gene colors only makes the process more complicated and with a lesser chance to get to Champagne.</span></td>
