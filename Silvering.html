	<td><span style="font-size:14">I have had many questions about silvering and the black gene.&nbsp; I've decided to put together this page to share some of my experiences with silvering and the blacks (or combined colors including black).&nbsp; Silvering occurs with all dwarves who have two black genes.&nbsp; This includes: black, blue, dove, chocolate, RE Lilac, Lilac, Dark Beige, and Champagne.<br><br>I really like the silvering with the black and blue colors so I have kept quite a few silvered hamsters.&nbsp; Many breeders do not like the silvering and do not keep them.&nbsp; I have also never mixed the platinum gene in with my blacks.&nbsp; I have even tested my more silvered blacks and blues to confirm that they are not platinum.&nbsp; When mating them to agoutis, I have never had a platinum baby.&nbsp; This shows that I do not have the existing dominant platinum gene mixed in with my blacks.<br><br>The question comes up whether you can have a black dwarf without silvering.&nbsp; You can have a youth without silvering.&nbsp; It appears that all will eventually silver if they live a normal lifespan, though.&nbsp; Some will silver more than others, but all will silver to some extent.&nbsp; People ask at what age theirs will start silvering.&nbsp; All are different.&nbsp; Some show the early signs of silvering as soon as their color shows (this white usually shows up on the shoulders first).&nbsp; Others take months to show silvering.&nbsp; And in colors like the Lilacs, it is very difficult to see the silvering at all if they silver evenly.&nbsp; They just get progressively lighter.<br><br>Is silvering a separate gene?&nbsp; We really don't know.&nbsp; It may be a separate gene or it may be part of the black gene.&nbsp; Tests are currently underway (here at my house as well as with other breeders) to try to determine this.&nbsp; So far I do not know of any conclusive evidence either way (see my other page for current research on this project)..<br><br>One of the interesting things about the silvering in the blacks (which also occurs with the platinums) is that the belly retains its color and does not silver.&nbsp; Also, the eyes, ears, and muzzle are the last parts to silver.&nbsp; People have commented that they look like raccoons with these markings.&nbsp; They are quite interesting and distinctive.</span></td>
