	<td><span style="font-size:14">When the black gene showed up in the dwarves, the hamsters were not the same jet black color as they were in the syrians.&nbsp; The most striking difference is that the black dwarves silver – or go gray – with age.&nbsp; Some show silvering when they first get their color.&nbsp; Others don’t show silvering until months later.&nbsp; All except some of the black mottleds have silvered with age (see my other page with silvering in the blacks for more detail).<br><br>It is not known whether silvering is part of the black gene or a separate but closely linked gene.&nbsp; The fact that some mottleds do not silver has lead people to suspect that they are two separate genes.&nbsp; It is also supposed that silvering is recessive just from its behavior.&nbsp; Once it is proven whether the silvering is a separate gene or part of the black gene, we can move to standardize the color in the dwarves.<br><br>I have kept the Platinum gene totally out of my black lines since I want to work with silvering, and the Platinum can easily be confused with silvering.&nbsp; I have never had any Platinums show up in these lines either.&nbsp; Since Platinum is dominant and can’t be carried, I was secure in the fact that the black lines I imported did not have Platinum.<br><br>Well, in early October of 2000, I had a Platinum-looking baby show up in these lines.&nbsp; He appears to be an Argente.&nbsp; The mother is a third generation female out of these lines.&nbsp; The father is a second generation hamster.&nbsp; Here is a picture of him as a baby with his Beige brother and RE Lilac sister plus a picture when he's two and a half months old..</span></td>

	<td><span style="font-size:14">The thought is that he may be a silvering agouti proving that silvering can be split from the Black gene.&nbsp; I decided to pair him to an unpatterned Blue Fawn from a line with no Black in it.&nbsp; It is believed that silvering is probably recessive so I was surprised to get three babies in the litter with white.&nbsp; One appears to have the white collar typical of Mottleds but not necessarily atypical of silvereds.&nbsp; The other two with white have the classic white on the shoulders typical of silvered but also possible on Mottleds.&nbsp; The Blue Fawn mother that I paired to the potentially silvering Argente had a mottled mother.&nbsp; The possibility exists that she is really mottled without any noticeable white.&nbsp; Of course the babies could also be silvered – and a couple really do look silvered.&nbsp; The next litter only had one with white, and it was the white on the shoulders.&nbsp; So there is some doubt as to whether these babies with white are mottled or silvered.&nbsp; Here are some pictures of the first litter.&nbsp; There are seven in the litter – three with white and four without white.</span></td>
