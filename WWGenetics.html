	<td colspan=7 rowspan=1 width=528><span style="font-size:14">The genetics in the Winter Whites is quite easy.&nbsp; There are only three genes.&nbsp; The color gene is recessive and the two pattern genes are dominant (same as in the Campbells).&nbsp; So sapphire is recessive while both pearl and imperial are dominant.&nbsp; There is of course also the normal agouti color which is just referred to as the normal and is the color of the animal in the wild.<br><br>In many ways, the dominant genes are easier to work with than the recessive genes.&nbsp; You only need one parent to have that gene present to produce babies with that pattern.&nbsp; Let's take an example.&nbsp; Suppose you have a pearl dwarf.&nbsp; You want to mate her to a sapphire even though no other hamster in his line has been pearl.&nbsp; Since pearl is dominant, you will still get approximately one half pearl babies from this pairing.<br><br>Because sapphire is recessive, though, the opposite is not true.&nbsp; If you have a sapphire who you want to mate to a pearl with no sapphire in her line (i.e. none of her ancestors were sapphire), you will not get any sapphire babies.&nbsp; All babies will carry sapphire but will not themselves have the sapphire coat color.&nbsp; If you then breed two of these babies which carry sapphire, approximately 25% of your babies will be sapphire.&nbsp; You can raise your chances by breeding a sapphire daughter back to her father.&nbsp; In this circumstance, approximately one half of their babies will be sapphire.&nbsp; So getting babies who show the gene with a dominant gene will usually happen in the first pairing while getting babies who show a recessive gene usually requires two pairings if you do not have two hamsters of that color.<br><br>There are a couple of other things to mention with the winter whites.&nbsp; First, many pearl males are sterile.&nbsp; Lately some lines with fertile males have shown up so this is not always true anymore.&nbsp; As shown above, having infertile males is not a problem since pearl is dominant.&nbsp; Even if only the female is pearl, you can still get about half pearl babies out of a pearl to non-pearl pairing.<br><br>Also, the imperial gene is homozygous lethal.&nbsp; No defective babies are actually born, though.&nbsp; Any babies which would have received two imperial genes (one from each parent or about 25% of the litter) will die in the womb and not be born.&nbsp; This is not generally considered a problem since it is believed that this may actually aid the mother both by decreasing the litter size and by giving her added protein and nutrition during pregnancy.&nbsp; Update:&nbsp; The imperial winter white gene mutation is now believed extinct.<br><br>The winter whites can interbreed with the Campbells, and the resulting pups are called &quot;hybrids.&quot;&nbsp; Please never do this.&nbsp; Also never breed known hybrids.&nbsp; This will endanger both species.&nbsp; There are actually countries and regions now where there are virtually no known pure winter whites.&nbsp; All have been crossed into the Campbells lines sometimes out of ignorance and sometimes to get the Campbells colors into the winter whites.&nbsp; These will never be pure.&nbsp; There are fewer winter white colors than Campbells colors although more mutations will occur with time.&nbsp; If the mutations occur within a hybrid line, though, they will never be recognized by show breeders.&nbsp; So always house and breed the two species separately.&nbsp; </span></td>
